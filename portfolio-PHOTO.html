        <h1>My Photography Portfolio:</h1>
        <h2>I primarily use my Sony A7S III camera with a 70-200mm F4 G OSS lens for photography. But also of course my phone when I don't have my camera, which is a Samsung A54, not particularly great as a camera but not too bad either, a couple of the pictures here were taken with it.</h2>
