        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <img src="assets/chess.jpg" alt="Chess">
        <p> I like playing chess, when playing online I prefer faster time controls (like bullet, where i'm top 2.5% on chess.com as seen above), but I prefer longer, more thought out games over the board.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="other">
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <img src="assets/video-games.jpg" alt="Video Games">
        <p> I like playing video games, some of my favorite games of all time are Minecraft, Hollow Knight, and Undertale. I used to play Minecraft very actively back in highschool, and I met many friends from all over the world thanks to it, some of which I've managed to meet in person.</p>

    <div class="other">
        <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
        <img src="assets/scuba-diving.png" alt="Scuba Diving">
        <p> I like scuba diving, I'm certified as an Advanced Open Water Diver, meaning I can dive up to 30 meters deep. I really enjoy being deep underwater, watching the sparkles of light barely reach me from above after dissipating in the water, it is a very uniquely calming and beautiful experience.</p>

        <h2>Brain Games</h2>

        <img src="assets/typeracer.png" alt="typeracer">
        <img src="assets/monkeytype.png" alt="monkeytype">
        <p> I like practicing fast typing on websites like typeracer and monkeytype, I can type consistently above 110 WPM with an accuracy of 98% or higher.</p> 
    </div>

    <div class="other">
        <h2>Spreadsheets</h2>
        <img src="assets/compression-spreadsheet.png" alt="spreadsheet1">
        <p> I like making spreadsheets to keep track of random bits of personal data, I realise that sounds very lame but I find it quite satisfying to organize information in a neat way. The image above was my compression spreadsheet where i tracked the file sizes of my phone camera roll archives after using the compression algorithms JpegXL and AV1</p>

    <div class="other">
        <h2>Politics and Economics</h2>
